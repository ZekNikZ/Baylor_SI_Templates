    \frq{The force $F$ (in Newtons) required to move a box of mass $m$ kg in motion by pulling on an attached rope (see the figure below) is $$F(\theta)=\frac{\mu_k m g}{\cos\theta+\mu_k\sin\theta}$$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the rope and the horizontal, $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $g=\v{9.81}$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Find the angle $\theta$ that minimizes the required force $F$, assuming that $\mu_k=0.5$.}
