    \activity{Warmup}{Concept Overview}{Work with a \textbf{partner} to answer these questions. Try not to use your notes.}{10 minutes}
    
    \frq{What is the expression for net change of a function $f(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$?}
    \smallspace
    
    \frq{What is distance? What is displacement? Given the velocity function $v(t)$, construct an integral to find both quantities on the interval $t=[0\text s,5\text s]$.}

    \frq{A survey shoes that a candidate is gaining votes at a rate of $2000t+1000$ votes per day, where $t$ is the number of days since she announced her candidacy. How many supporters will the candidate have after 60 days (assuming that she had no supporters at $t=0$)?}

    \frq{A particle moves in a straight line with velocity $v(t)=t^{-2}-1$ m/s. Find the displacement and total distance traveled over the time interval $[0.5,2]$ seconds.}
    \hugespace
    
%    \frq{Over the course of $\pi$ seconds, a particle moves in a straight line with velocity $v(t)=t+\sin t$ m/s. What was the total distance and displacement of the particle on its journey?}

    \frq{Water flows out of a $10000$L tank at a rate of $1000+25t$ liters per hour (where $t$ is in hours). Assuming the tank was full to start, how much water is left after $4$ hours?}
    \pagebreak
    
%    \frq{The traffic flow rate past a certain point on a highway is $q(t)=3000+2000t-300t^2$ ($t$ is in hours), where $t=0$ is 8am. How many cars pass by in the time interval from 8 to 10am?}
