    \frq{A $12 \ft$ ladder is resting against a wall. Unfortunately, the construction worker who put up this ladder somehow did not know the wall was slippery, so as he climbs the ladder it starts to slide to the ground. At the moment when the height of the top of the ladder is $8 \ft$, the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall is 2$\ftps$. How fast is the top of the ladder falling at that moment?}

    \frq{What is the rate of change of the volume of a cylinder with respect to its height at the moment when its radius is 2 m, if, for this particular cylinder, its height is always three times its radius?}

    \frq{Your cat Jimmy was playing on your kitchen counter when it accidentally knocks over a salt shaker. Bad Jimmy. The salt shaker pours salt over the counter at a rate of $\SI{3}{\centi\meter^2/\second}$ and collects into a cone of salt on the ground. At any point in time, the height of the cone is always equal to its diameter. What is the rate of change of the radius of the cone of salt at the moment when its height is $\SI{2}{\centi\meter}$?}

    \frq{You are at Texas' premier hot air balloon festival. A very ugly purple and white balloon is rising at a constant speed of $\SI{5}{\meter/\second}$. If you are standing 4 km away from the lift-off point of the balloon, what is the rate of change of the angle between the ground and your line-of-sight with respect to time when the distance between you and the balloon (diagonally) is 5 km?}

    \frq{A buoy in a river is moving downstream at a speed of $\SI{0.5}{\meter/\second}$. A boat is moving perpendicular to the flow of the water at a speed of $\SI{1.0}{\meter/\second}$. At the moment when the distance between the boat and buoy is $5.0$ m and the horizontal distance is 4 m, what is the rate of change of this distance? }

    \frq{Evil McScquiivel just robbed the ReallyRich Bank and is driving north in his getaway car at a speed of 60 mph. The cops are following him northbound when Mr. McScquiivel turns east. When the cops are 0.5 mi from the intersection and Mr. McScquiivel is 1 mi from the intersection, the rate of change of the distance between the cars is $-\frac{100}{\sqrt{2}}$ mph. What is the speed of the cop car?}

    \frq{You are bored from your studying and you find a laser pointer. Naturally, you turn it on and point it at the wall 8 m across the room to entertain yourself (and your cat Jimmy). You rotate the laser in your hand at a rate of $\frac{\pi}{9}$ rad/s. Let $\theta$ be the angle between the beam and the direct line between you and the wall (perpendicular to the wall). How fast is this dot moving when $\theta=\frac{\pi}{6}$ deg?}

    \frq{The First Gent, Brad Livingstone, is walking away from Moody Library after a late-night meet and greet. A lightpost by Moody is 8' tall and causes Brad to cast a shadow on the ground. Brad, who is 6'10'' tall and is walking at a speed of 4 ft/s is wondering what the rate at which his shadow is increasing in length is. Let's help him out.}
