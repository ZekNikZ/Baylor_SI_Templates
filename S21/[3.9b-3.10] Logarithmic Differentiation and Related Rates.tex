    \frq{A $12 \ft$ ladder is resting against a wall. Unfortunately, the construction worker who put up this ladder somehow did not know the wall was slippery, so as he climbs the ladder it starts to slide to the ground. At the moment when the height of the top of the ladder is $8 \ft$, the rate at which the bottom of the ladder is moving away from the wall is 2$\ftps$. How fast is the top of the ladder falling at that moment?}

    \frq{What is the rate of change of the volume of a cylinder with respect to its height at the moment when its radius is 2 m, if, for this particular cylinder, its height is always three times its radius?}

    \frq{Your cat Jimmy was playing on your kitchen counter when it accidentally knocks over a salt shaker. Bad Jimmy. The salt shaker pours salt over the counter at a rate of $\SI{3}{\centi\meter^3/\second}$ and collects into a cone of salt on the ground. At any point in time, the height of the cone is always equal to its diameter. What is the rate of change of the radius of the cone of salt at the moment when its height is $\SI{2}{\centi\meter}$?}
    \Largesp
    \frq{You are at Texas' premier hot air balloon festival. A very ugly purple and white balloon is rising at a constant speed of $\SI{5}{\meter/\second}$. If you are standing 4 km away from the lift-off point of the balloon, what is the rate of change of the angle between the ground and your line-of-sight with respect to time when the distance between you and the balloon (diagonally) is 5 km?}
