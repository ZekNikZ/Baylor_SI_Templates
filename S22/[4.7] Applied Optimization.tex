    \mcq{For each scenario below, find the objective/key function (i.e., the function that you will eventually take the derivative of).}{
        \task Find two positive numbers such that their product is 192 and the sum of the first plus three times the second is as small as possible.
        \Smallsp
        \task You are constructing a cardboard box with the dimensions \SI{2}{\meter} by \SI{4}{m}. You then cut equal-size squares from each corner so you may fold the edges. What are the dimensions of the box with the largest volume?
        \Smallsp
        \task A \SI{5}{\meter} piece of string is bent into an L-shape. Where should the bend be made to minimize the distance between the two ends?
        \Smallsp
        \task A rancher will use 600 feet of fencing to build a corral in the shape of a semicircle on top of a rectangle. Find the dimensions that maximize the area of the corral.

    \mcq{Your task is to design a rectangular industrial warehouse consisting of three separate spaces of equal size as in the figure below. The wall materials cost \$500 per linear meter and your company allocates \$2,400,000 for that part of the project involving the walls.}{

        \task What is the area of each compartment in this case?

    \frq{Owners of a rental car company have determined that if they charge customers $p$ dollars per day to rent a car, where $50\leq p\leq 200$, the number of cars $n$ they rent per day can be modeled by the linear function $n(p)=1000-5p$. If they charge $\$50$ per day or less, they will rent all their cars. If they charge $\$200$ per day or more, they will not rent any cars. Assuming the owners plan to charge customers between $\$50$ per day and $\$200$ per day to rent a car, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?}
    \Hugesp
    \frq{If instead $n(p)$ was $n(p)=\dfrac{1}{40}(p-200)^2$, how much should they charge to maximize their revenue?}

%    \frq{The force $F$ (in Newtons) required to move a box of mass $m$ kg in motion by pulling on an attached rope (see the figure below) is $$F(\theta)=\frac{\mu_k m g}{\cos\theta+\mu_k\sin\theta}$$ where $\theta$ is the angle between the rope and the horizontal, $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of kinetic friction and $g=\v{9.81}$ is the acceleration due to gravity. Find the angle $\theta$ that minimizes the required force $F$, assuming that $\mu_k=0.5$.}
