    \frq{All units in a 30-unit apartment building are rented out when the rent is set at $r=\$2000$ per month. A survey reveals that for each \$100 increase in rent, demand for apartments will decrease, such that one additional apartment becomes vacant. Suppose that each occupied unit costs \$200 per month in maintenance. Which rent $r$ maximizes monthly profit? (Set up the problem, stop before you take a derivative.)}
